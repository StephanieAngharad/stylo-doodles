# Submit An Image

Do you have an image you'd love to share with the community? Submitting your
own image to the gallery is done by opening a pull request against the
[stylo-doodles](https://github.com/alcarney/stylo-doodles) repository adding
your image as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to the `notebooks/`
folder.

In order for your notebook to integrate into the website's build system you
also need to do the following.

1. Your image *must* be stored in a variable called `image`
2. You also need to define a dictionary called `info` *in the very first cell
   of the notebook*.

This dictionary needs to contain the following information

```python
info = {
 "title": "Your Image Title",
 "author": "Your Name",
 "github_username": "your_github_username",
 "stylo_version": "0.6.0",
 "dimensions": (1920, 1080)
}
```

- `stylo_version`: Should be set to the value of `stylo.__version__` when
 you created your image.
- `dimensions`: Should be set to the tuple `(width, height)`. These
 dimensions will be used when the full size version of your image is
 generated by the build.

You can use the existing [notebooks](https://github.com/alcarney/stylo-doodles/tree/master/notebooks)
as a guide. Be sure to drop by the stylo [gitter](https://gitter.im/stylo-py/Lobby)
chat room if you get stuck we'll be happy to help!
