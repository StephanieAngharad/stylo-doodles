# stylo-doodles

This repository contains a number of example images/animations that have been
made with the python package [stylo](https://github.com/alcarney/stylo).

The plan is to eventually compile these into a static example gallery website.

## Requirements

If you want to try any of these examples for yourself you need the following
python packages installed

- stylo
- jupyter

see what you make with it!
