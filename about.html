<p>Stylo Doodles is a an community driven image gallery. All images have been

the chance to make their visions a reality with a little bit of help from the
worlds of mathematics and Python.</p>

possible and get inspiration for their own projects. Somewhere anyone can
submit and share their own creations and help inspire the rest of the
community.</p>
